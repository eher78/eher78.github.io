Throughout history, the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World were a representation of the achievements people constructured in regards to culture, arts, and societal communication. These seven constructions are represented by some historians as some of the earliest developments of the ancient world. All except for one structure (Great Pyramid of Giza) has been destroyed or lost in history by human and environmental factors. The list of the remaining structures part of the Seven Wonders includes:

- Hanging Gardens of Babylon
- Statue of Zeus at Olympia
- Temple of Artemis at Ephesus
- Mausoleum at Halicarnassus
- Colossus of Rhodes
- Lighthouse of Alexandria

My goal or scope of this visual project is to attempt and recreate some of these constructions using a generative adversial networks from primary sources in an attempt to be as historically accurate as possible. Understandibly, there has been history of some recreations and reconstructions with some images but the purpose of this is determing what the capabilities of machine learning can be used to evaluate a historically significant construction given some documented context. 

In addition, the other key aspect of this project is to represent a two dimensional image with a three dimensional object from the image. This is to not only capture some of the finer details within an image but also understand the loss and physical fragments of a history that once existed thousands of years ago.

Hence, it will be interesting to find out what a computer thinks or imagines what a historically significant structure was in time and what a human thinks of the result of the recreated image. 

Throughout this research, the project I wish to explore during my senior year in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln will hopefully give some insights into the following questions:

- Could a computer accurately and precisely recreate a historical artifact from numerous sources? 
- To what extent could a human and computer determine which features are necessary for historical recreation?
- How closely can a computer interpret details from historical text into an image or artifact?


## Timeline
Throughout the rest of the year, I will be posting some updates in regards to my processes and research towards this project. Things that I would like to cover includes but not limited to:

- Sources towards the Seven Wonders
- Color Analysis on Images
- "Generational" Loss in regards to Text
- Textual Analysis

and so much more.

Stay tuned to hear the upcoming developments on this project!
